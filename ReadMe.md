A Flappy Bird Style Game

This game is a very simple representation of a tap and play game similar to "Flappy Bird".

This variation requires sound input to make the Bird jump.  Any time the microphone registers sound, it will trigger the Bird to jump.
The entire game can be played with just sound.  Restarting can occur by sound trigger as well. 
Microphone Input class was taken from: http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/check-current-microphone-input-volume.133501/
